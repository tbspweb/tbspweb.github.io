Tahoe Backcountry Ski Patrol is always looking for dedicated and enthusiastic winter backcountry lovers to join the patrol. TBSP is in search of folks willing to learn a new set of skills or two, while spending their weekends serving skiers, snowboarders and snowshoers that venture out into the mountains north of Tahoe. We invite anyone interested in learning more about the backcountry ski patrol to schedule a ski-along this season. Keep an eye out for our trailhead signs and white crosses the next time you're out earning your turns!
