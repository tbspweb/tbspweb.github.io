Tahoe Backcountry Ski Patrol is a group of volunteers dedicated to helping make the Tahoe backcountry safer for everyone. We are all members of the National Ski Patrol, but instead of ski areas we patrol the public lands around Lake Tahoe and Truckee. We train all our members in emergency medicine, winter travel/survival, and search and rescue skills. There are currently over 50 skiers/riders on the patrol ranging in age from early 20s to early 60s and in ski ability from advanced intermediate to jaw-dropping rippers. TBSP patrollers get around on telemark or randonnee gear and on split-boards. We patrol the backcountry together in groups of 3 or more every winter weekend from December to mid-April.
