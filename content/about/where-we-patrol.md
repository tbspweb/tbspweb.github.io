title: "Where We Patrol"
---
Most of our patrolling takes place in California's Tahoe National Forest, specifically in the sizeable Castle Peak area north of Donner Summit and on the Pacific Crest Trail. It's the most popular destination that we patrol, not just among backcountry skiers and snowboarders, but also a fair share of snowshoe enthusiasts, whom we often encounter in sizeable groups out for the day or for a winter camp. Other Tahoe Forest destinations are various corniced ridges and traverses adjacent to the popular local ski resorts of Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, and Sugar Bowl. Our other primary patrol destination is Nevada's Tahoe Meadows area and its neighboring wilderness zones near Mount Rose, perched high above Incline Village with breathtaking views of Lake Tahoe.
