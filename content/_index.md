## Join us on patrol!

Tahoe Backcountry Ski Patrol is always looking for dedicated and enthusiastic winter backcountry lovers to join the patrol. TBSP is in search of folks willing to learn a new set of skills or two, while spending their weekends serving skiers, snowboarders and snowshoers that venture out into the mountains north of Tahoe.
