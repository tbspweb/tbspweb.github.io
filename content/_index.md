Tahoe Backcountry Ski Patrol promotes fun, safe, and responsible winter recreation by providing education, delivering outreach, and rendering assistance to the Tahoe Region winter sports community.

## Join us on patrol!

Tahoe Backcountry Ski Patrol is always looking for dedicated and enthusiastic winter backcountry lovers to join the patrol. TBSP is in search of folks willing to learn a new set of skills or two, while spending their weekends serving skiers, snowboarders and snowshoers that venture out into the mountains north of Tahoe.

We invite anyone interested in learning more about the backcountry ski patrol to [schedule a ski-along](http://wiki.tbsp.org/TBSP_Introduction) this season. Keep an eye out for our trailhead signs and white crosses the next time you're out earning your turns!

**Contact us today to schedule a ski along, the best way to learn more about the patrol.**

### What We Offer

**Training and Certification**: Training and certification to the standards of the National Ski Patrol. All TBSP members are also NSP members, working closely with the organization at the Region and Division levels.

**Community Partnership**: TBSP has partnered with the Tahoe Backcountry Alliance to advocate for backcountry access and to provide [Trafx trail counters](https://www.trafx.net) at popular backcountry destinations.
